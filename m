Way back there was google's code search, which was awesome. Now I just
put the structure name/ioctl #define/number into
google/bing/duckduckgo and see if anything turns up. Plus check how
it's used in fb tools (although I just recently learned that fb-test
pretty much disappeared from the internet, very hard to find the
original).

If you're unsure, we can merge a patch, then wait about 1 year for any
users to show up with problems. If that's not the case, assume they're
all gone, or it was never used and just implemented because it was
copied from somewhere else, or "just in case". There's lots of dead
uapi around.

Yeah fbcon.c is pretty good horrors unfortunately :-/
