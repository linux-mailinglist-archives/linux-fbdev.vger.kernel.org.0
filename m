Just an aside: I think with fbdev drivers this would go boom, because
you'd have fbcon interferring with a direct /dev/fb/* user.

But if your fbdev driver is actually a drm modeset driver, then we
have additional limitations: If the userspace accesses the display
through /dev/dri/card0, then the kernel blocks all access through
/dev/fb/* (including fbcon) to the actual display (it only goes into
the buffer used for fbdev emulation). And everything would be fine.

Also generally you'd get away with this even in problematic cases,
since usually you resize your console when looking at it, not when X
or something else is using your fbdev direct access.

The one thing that's left out here a bit in the cold is userspace
modeset drivers in X. Those would get hosed. But also, we stopped
supporting those in at least i915/amd/radeon/nouveau drivers,
automatically falling back to the fbdev stuff in most cases (with or
without the drm drivers underneath that), and no one screamed. So
probably not many users left.

So I /think/ we could wager this, if it's the least intrusive fix from
the kernel pov. But it has some risks that we need to revert again if
we break some of the really old use-cases here.

Cheers, Daniel
