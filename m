Yeah should work, except if the ptes are set up already there's kinda not
much that this will prevent. We'd need to tear down mappings and SIGBUS or
alternatively have something else in place there so userspace doesn't blow
up in funny ways (which is what we're doing on the drm side, or at least
trying to).

I'm also not sure how much we should care, since ideally for drm drivers
this is all taken care of by drm_dev_enter in the right places. It does
mean though that fbdev mmap either needs to have it's own memory or be
fully redirected to the drm gem mmap.

And then we can afford to just not care to fix fbdev itself.
