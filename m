You don't need maintainership to fix issues. You need to submit patches.

If otoh you get the maintainership first to be able to cram in reverts
without discussions, then it's very backwards.

I already added dri-devel so anything we drastically change can be
discussed first. If that's indeed not strong enough then yes I can
whack in full maintainer entry with a bugfix-only status.

But really I try to not create facts with just editing MAINTAINERS
first and ask questions later, that's just not a great way to
collaborate.
