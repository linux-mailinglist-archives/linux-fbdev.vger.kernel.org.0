   I am debugging/testing glx and suspend issues on an i586 computer. 
With the vesa driver suspend works and there are no glx problems (since 
it does not support glx). However it only allows for 800x600 instead of 
1024x768 and no external monitor. Now I thought that a framebuffer based 
solution would work best on this computer. However if I want to

> modprobe uvesafb
uvesafb: failed to execute /sbin/v86d
uvesafb: getting VBE info block failed (eax=0x4f00, err=-2)
uvesafb: vbe_init failed with -22

   However there is no sense to have an v86d on an i586 system since you 
would not like to emulate code that is running natively on this machine!
What about a fix for this issue?

   Secondly I have discovered that echo 0 
 >/sys/class/vtconsole/vtcon1/bind hangs my system if nouveau is loaded 
and modesettting isn´t disabled. I was working on the console without 
running an X-server. That seems to be a bug and a regression, too, since 
I remember that having worked in order to switch to another console 
graphics mode driver.
