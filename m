Note the actual proposal for the new usespace API for display brightness
control is here:

https://lore.kernel.org/dri-devel/b61d3eeb-6213-afac-2e70-7b9791c86d2e@redhat.com/

I have finished / stabilized the backlight code refactor which I landed
in 6.1, which is a prerequisite for the above proposal. But I have not
been able to make time to actually implement the above proposal; and
I don't know when I will be able to make time for this.

So mutter (gnome-shell compositor library) has a similar issue when saving
monitor layouts and I can tell you beforehand that monitor serial numbers
by themselves are not unique enough. Some models just report 123456789
as serial and if you have a dual-monitor setup with 2 such monitors
and name the backlight class device <serial>-vcp-hid or something like that
you will still end up with 2 identical names.

To avoid this when saving monitor layouts mutter saves both the port
to which the monitor is attached (e.g. DP-1 DP-2) and the serialnumber
and on startup / monitor hotplug when it checks to see if it has saved
layout info for the monitor it checks the port+serialnr combination.

So what I think you should do is figure out a way to map which
VCP HID device maps to which drm-connector and then use
the connector-name + serial-nr to generate the backlight device name.

We will need the mapping the a drm-connector object anyway for
the new brightness API proposal from above.

Note this does NOT solve the fact that registering a new backlight
class device for an external monitor on a laptop will hopelessly
confuse userspace, see:

https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/7f2d88de-60c5-e2ff-9b22-acba35cfdfb6@redhat.com/

Hans
