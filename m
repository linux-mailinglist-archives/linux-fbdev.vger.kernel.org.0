This should be a lot better in recent kernels, there's been tons of fixes
for drm hotunplug. Might be there's still bugs in the drm/udl driver.

Hm this should in general work on drm drivers. Without that it's clear the
switch-over isn't really ready yet.

We're looking for people to port the missing features over to the drm
drivers. The problem is that fbdev is full of security bugs, and we're
fixing them by removing the features. So that's why there's some push to
sunset at much as possible.
