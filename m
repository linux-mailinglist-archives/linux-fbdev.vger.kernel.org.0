Noralf, thanks for your response, my comments below.

TBH I would also like to hear from maintainers, because it seems they got
an additional burden for no benefit.

I believe it can't. Otherwise we _must_ provide the DT (device property)
parser that uses what is provided for fbtft SPI to be enabled in the other
driver.

Oh, sad to hear this, hope you will get better sooner than later!

Why was it appeared in the first place? :-(

Everything like this is possible, just somebody needs to fulfill that.
And as I said, new OF-centric code, has to be NAKed by default.

I wonder who has enough experience and time to at least point out or do
something about this...

At least we can start combining the two in tinydrm, to reduce the variety.
