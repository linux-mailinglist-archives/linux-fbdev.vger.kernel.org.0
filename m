Hello Thomas,

Thanks for your feedback and comments.

Agreed. I can push it to drm-misc-next.

Yes, that's what we discussed on IRC some time ago.

And this is the common case, since most kernels will have some driver
that binds to a platform device registered to provide the firmware FB.

Indeed.

Agreed. And as mentioned, the race that these patches attempt to fix are for
the less common case when a native driver probes but either no generic driver
registered a framebuffer yet or the platform device wasn't registered yet.

But this can only happen if for example a native driver is built-in but the
generic driver is build as a module, which is not the common configuration.

What most distros do is the opposite, to have {simple,of,efi,vesa}fb or
simpledrm built-in and the native drivers built as modules.

So there's no rush to fix this by piling more hacks on top of the ones we
already have and instead try to fix it more properly as you suggested.
