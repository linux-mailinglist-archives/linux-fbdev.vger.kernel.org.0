Not sure who you talked to, but we have drivers with fbdev bitblt
accel (well, in some cases had, because driver maintainers decided
it's just not worth it and ripped it out again or never merged it).
Also the other discussions about some low-bit formats is pretty much
just a question of extending a few enums and wiring through the fbdev
emulation layer. So the things brought up in this thread thus far are
actually the fairly easy items, which should take at most a handful of
patches to rectify. There's much more nastier issues in fbdev, which
will take serious amounts of development time to fix.

Unfortunately in the past 5+ years absolutely no one stepped up with
actual patches, which is why fbdev was marked as orphaned in
MAINTAINERS.
