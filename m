I don't know the answer in detail, but it is quite possible that
checkpatch doesn't pay any attention to the delay argument.  Checkpatch is
a perl script that highlights things that may be of concern.  It is not a
precise static analsis tool.

As a matter of form, all of your Please review comments should have been
put below the ---.  Currently, if someone had wanted to apply the patch,
you would make them do extra work to remove this information.
