tiny drivers are the state of the art for small neat drivers. As you
pointed out multiple times now there's not Rx or Cx support for x < 8
in drm or fbdev yet, so that would need to be added. If someone cares
enough for that. Some of the fbtft drivers have gone down
substantially when ported to tiny, which is really the claim we've put
down. Not that you'll find the perfect C4 pixel format example in
there, at most you find C8 support in some of the really old drivers
like i915/radeon/nouveau for old platforms. But that's very well
burried.

I guess in practice (as you point out below) the repaper display is so
glacially slow anyway and connected to machines with enough ram that
generally the only case that mattered was convenience and hence
supporting what every drm userspace can cope with minimally. Which is
xrgb8888. So yeah don't look at a driver which updates at roughly
0.5fps for efficient upload code :-) The space wasting is a bit more
important and should be trivial to add if someone cares enough to do
that.
