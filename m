We never committed to supporting that binding in the first place, and
that code is in staging, so I don't see why we must do that.

It's probably an oversight. The name was far from obvious to begin with.

I'm not sure it's worth it tbh. Panel drivers are fairly straightforward
and easy to maintain, and getting a driver that can support all the
variations of the power sequences those driver need would make a very
complicated driver.

And MIPI-DPI display are becoming more and more irrelevant. Small,
cheap, display will keep using MIPI-DBI, and middle and high-end screens
are using MIPI-DSI/eDP.
