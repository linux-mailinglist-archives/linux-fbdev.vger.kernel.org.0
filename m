Yes, the original version did that but also the original version didn't
attempt to remove the devices registered by sysfb on sysfb_disable().

I was going to answer that this has to be done after the loop because
that way fbmem could first ask sysfb to remove the devices, but then I
realized that you are correct That this wouldn't be needed if sysfb does
the disable (and unregistration) before the loop.

So by doing it before the loop, we should be able to drop [PATCH v5 4/7]
fbdev: Make sysfb to unregister its own registered devices:

https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/dri-devel/2022-May/355201.html

Since by the time the loop is executed, no registered_fb associated with
a device that was registered by sysfb should be present in that array.
