If we go with "way too complex" no one should try writing good linux
drivers in general, because with the bazillion of helpers, different
subsystems and specific solution for pretty much any possible problem
you might ever have, the linux kernel overall is "way too complex".

Yes it's overwhelming and also dri-devel is a chaotic firehose, but
let's try to address these issues instead of creating tiny little
corners where nothing happens, but at least things are simple.

Maybe Greg needs to expand his "I'll help you upstream your drivers"
project to drm? We're trying to do that but sometimes it's a bit too
much chaos, and also no one is actually paid in drm to do that kind of
work even part time (except contracting for specific customers, but
that's not the problem here I think).
