Fair. I'm definitely not one of them :)

I don't know. At least I haven't found them.

That's correct, yes. I think that any driver that provides a .mmap file
operation would have the same issue. But drivers keep an internal state
and just return -ENODEV or whatever on read/write/close after a removal.

The fbdev subsystem is different though since as you said it, the fbdev
core unconditionally calls to the driver .fb_release() callback with a
struct fb_info reference as argument.

I tried to prevent that with commit aafa025c76dc ("fbdev: Make fb_release()
return -ENODEV if fbdev was unregistered") but Daniel pointed out that
is was wrong since could leak memory allocated and was expected to be
freed on release.

That's why I instead fixed the issue in the fbdev drivers and just added
a warn on fb_release(), that is $SUBJECT.

That was my question actually, do we need something to be called in the
destroy path ? Since that could just be internal to the DRM fb helpers.

In other words, drivers should only care about setting a generic fbdev
by calling drm_fbdev_generic_setup(), and then do any HW cleanup in the
removal path, but let the fb helpers to handle the SW cleanup in destroy.
