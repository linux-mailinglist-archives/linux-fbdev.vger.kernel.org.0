The fb_info shouldn't go boom because that's refcounted with
get/put_fb_info. Maybe we go boom on something else, but the fb_info
itself should work out ok. If it doesn't work, then there's a bug and
papering over it by just leaking it all isn't a solution.

We should probably nuke the mmap and make it SIGBUS. This is essentially
the hotunplug problem, and fixing it properly is very nasty.
