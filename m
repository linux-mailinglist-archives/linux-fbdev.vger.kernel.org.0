Not really (afaics), but I made that clearer recently. To quote from my
own text below:

If you search the history, you'll find quite a few commits (some really
old) that use 'Link:' to point to bugtracker or regression reports.
'References:' is used as well, but mainly by the drm subsystem.

But yes, sadly the Link tag historically is overloaded and used for
different things afaics. I'm all for fixing this and plan to start a
discussion about this in the next few days (hopefully it doesn't become
weeks), but for now I have a few issues with regzbot I need to deal with
first.

Ciao, Thorsten
