Dear Friend.


I'm happy to inform you about my success in getting those funds
transferred under the co-operation of a new partner from Paraguay.
Presently i'm in Paraguay for investment projects with my own share of
the total sum. meanwhile,i didn't forget your efforts and attempts to
assist me that time despite that the transaction failed us due to our
financial incapability.  But for your humanity and efforts to help me
that time, i decided to sign a bank draft the sum of US$1.200,000.00
to you as COMPENSATION as i know that you tried your best that time to
assist me.


Now, contact my secretary Chester Barbara on this e-mail address
(chesterbarbara@yahoo.com) ask her to send you the bank draft I kept
for your compensation. As soon as you receive it try to let me know
ok, when ever i am less busy i will come to visit you and your family.


Best Regards,
Stanley Solomon
