Hello Thomas,

Thanks for the feedback. It was very useful.

You meant that should *not* get merged, as we discussed over IRC.

That's correct, yes.

Exactly, should be done when the device is registered rather than when
the driver is registered or a call is made to remove the conflicting FB.

I'll rework this series with only the bits for sysfb_disable() and drop
the rest. We can go back to the discussion of the remaining parts later
if that makes sense (I still think that patch 3/5 is a better approach,
but let's defer that for a different series).
