Hi all, i think when it comes to a significant change in the code, we
should at least be familiar with the driver or be able to test the
change.

In the very beginning of the Documentation/timers/timers-howto.rst
there is the question:
"Is my code in an atomic context?"
It's not just about the range, it's more of at which context this code
runs, for atomic-context -> udelay must be used.
for non-atomic context -> usleep-range is better for power-management.

unless we are familiar with the driver we wouldn't really know in what
context this code is run at.

This thread though had the same conversation about this change, for the
same driver.
