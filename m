Maybe don't rush maintainer changes in over the w/e without even bothering
to get any input from the people who've been maintaining it before.

Because the status isn't entirely correct, fbdev core code and fbcon and
all that has been maintained, but in bugfixes only mode. And there's very
solid&important reasons to keep merging these patches through a drm tree,
because that's where all the driver development happens, and hence also
all the testing (e.g. the drm test suite has some fbdev tests - the only
automated ones that exist to my knowledge - and we run them in CI). So
moving that into an obscure new tree which isn't even in linux-next yet is
no good at all.

Now fbdev driver bugfixes is indeed practically orphaned and I very much
welcome anyone stepping up for that, but the simplest approach there would
be to just get drm-misc commit rights and push the oddball bugfix in there
directly. But also if you want to do your own pull requests to Linus for
that I don't care and there's really no interference I think, so
whatever floats.

But any code that is relevant for drm drivers really needs to go in through
drm trees, nothing else makes much sense.

I guess you're first action as newly minted fbdev maintainer is going to be to
clean up the confusion you just created.

Cheers, Daniel
