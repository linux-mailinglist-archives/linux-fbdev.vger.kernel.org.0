Still the same with PCIe, probably gotten worse since uncached reads are
still as slow, but write-combined writes have gotten much faster even.
There's work going on to have a coherent link to gpus which would allow
fully cached reads and writes, early with nvlink and now as a standard
with CXL (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compute_Express_Link)

But that's aimed at big compute jobs for servers, not really for display.

Also some on-die gpus have become fully coherent, but again only for
render/compute buffers, not for the display framebuffer.

So all together 0 signs this is changing going forward, reading from
framebuffers is slow.

Ok there's some exceptions: For manual update buffers (defio for fbdev
drivers, drm also supports this with an entire set of helpers) the
framebuffer used by the cpu is sometimes (but very often still not)
cached. Imo not worth optimizing for, since for the drivers where it is
cached they either have no blitter, or it's really tiny panels behind spi
links and similar, so not going to be fast anyway.
