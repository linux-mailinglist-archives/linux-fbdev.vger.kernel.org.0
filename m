Hello Thomas!

> terrible to maintain.

Hmm, don't get me wrong but I'm not sure if the changes were really
checked in detail. At first sight it might look like I'm adding tons of
new macro ridden code in those header files replacing cleaner code.

While actually that's just how the I/O version currently is, copied and
white space cleaned (as it was requested) plus comment style matched
with sys.

The only new thing which hides the mentioned abstraction a little more
is FB_MEM, which replaced __iomem. But that's a tradeoff to be able to
use the same source for system as well.

Or the concern is that now system memory specific code might get mixed
in there by mistake?

It was not planned as the final version, the current maintainer asked
for addressing some pre-existing quality issues with further patches but
otherwise accepted the taken approach.

Yes, there are architectures where these two don't mix at all, I'm aware
of that. I need that on x86 only (for old hw), and there it seems
doable. Depending on the resolution either the aperture or the defio
memory is mapped. If the framebuffer is not remapped after a mode change
that's an application bug. Otherwise it's harmless as both are always
there and don't change.

I'd better like to find out problems sooner than later, so if you or
anyone else could share any concerns that'd be really helpful!

Actually that's what I did first. Then did it once more by adapting the
I/O version as that gave me more confidence that it'll work exactly the
same and there's less room for error.
