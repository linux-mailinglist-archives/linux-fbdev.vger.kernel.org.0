I added dri-devel for fbdev because stuff landed that shouldn't have.
Let's not remove that, because the amount of patches for fbdev which
arent relevant for drm drivers is pretty much nothing.

I really don't like the idea that fbdev goes off again becoming a
silo, just because it's too hard to wire through low-bit greyscale
support. Which no I can't type for you, because I don't have such hw
here.

Everything where people cared enough for adding fbdev compat support
for to actually write a patch is supported.

If you do want a silo  for fbdev then I think the only reasonable
option is that we create a copy of the fbdev/fbcon code for drm
(somewhat renamed), so that you can do the reverts without impacting
drm drivers. But there will still be some overlap and minimal
coordination, plus I'm not seeing anyone from the drm side
volunteering for the sizeable amount of work.
