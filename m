I second that getting commit rights in drm-misc and pushing the changes
there makes much more sense than keeping a separate tree for fbdev.

Not only for the fbdev core and fbcon but also for fbdev drivers. There
is common for fbdev drivers bugs to be exposed after DRM changes, so it
is more convenient to push fixes for these through the same tree as well.

As an example, just last week I had to fix issues in the vga16fb driver
that started to occur after a change to support simpledrm in aarch64:

https://lore.kernel.org/all/20220111131601.u36j6grsvnir5gvp@houat/T/

If there is a separate tree for fbdev, then this would require to do
some coordination, share and merge immutable branches, etc for no
clear benefit.
