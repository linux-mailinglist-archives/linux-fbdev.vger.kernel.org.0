You need to add in a shadow buffer and it's fast. The problem is that
the default fbcon sw code just replaces a hw blitter, and so does a
_lot_ of memmoves reading from wc/uc memory. Which is an absolute
disaster and results in a slideshow.

Once you stop doing that the thing is pretty reasonable, which would
also be what all the userspace sw compositors are doing. Fact that no
one bothers to roll this out for most drivers just shows how little
people care about accelerated fbcon.
