It maybe result in leaks, that's true. But I don't think we can do anything
at this point since the fb_info just went away and the file->private_data
reference is no longer valid...

This is fixing a NULL pointer deref that at least 3 people reported, i.e:

https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/issues/5011

Because if a real DRM driver is probed, then the registered framebuffer
is unregistered and the fb_info just freed. But user-space has no way to
know and on close the kernel will try to dereference a NULL pointer.

Yes, but I don't know how that could work since user-space can just open
the fbdev, mmap it, write to the mmap'ed memory and then close it. The
only way that this could be done safely AFAICT is if we prevent the real
video drivers to be registered if the fbdev is currently mmap'ed.

Otherwise, the firmware initialized framebuffer will go away anyways and
things will break for the user-space process that's currently using it.
