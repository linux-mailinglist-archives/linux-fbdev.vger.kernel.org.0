Since you say 4k it's a modern box, so you have on the order of 10GB/s of
write bandwidth.

And around 100MB/s of read bandwidth. Both from the cpu. It all adds up.
It's that uncached read which kills you and means dmesg takes seconds to
display.

Also since this is 4k looking at sales volume we're talking integrated, so
whether it's the gpu or the cpu that's doing the memcpy, it's the same
memory bw budget you're burning down. And at that point doing less copying
(which the shadow buffer thing will do compared to fbcon accelerated
scrolling for every line) is the win.

And since max&usual resolutions pretty much scales down with pcie or
memory bandwidth for roughly the last 2-3 decades, this all works as well
on old stuff.
