It's just really old code that's been barely touched to keep it going.

The issue is that the entire defio stuff is pretty bad layering violation.
Not sure what the cleanest way to do this really would be if it only
touches the ptes and nothing else. Not sure what's the right function for
a bit of pte walking for that.

That would still potentially mess with the mapping by the gpu memory
allocator in bad ways, but I think at least for all current ones it should
avoid problems.

Definitely agree that messing with struct page in any way is really bad,
we simply didn't get that far yet.

I think the cleanest way would be if we have a fb_mmap only for drm
drivers in drm_fbdev_generic.c and sunset fb_deferred_io_mmap and use that
to just replicate the ptes from the kernel's vmap into one that is ok for
userspace. The fbdev implementation in drm_fbdev_generic.c is the only one
left in drm that supports fb_defio, so that would catch all of them. To my
knowledge all the other defio implementations in native fbdev drivers
aren't problematic since none use shmem.

For I while we pondered with proxying the vma to the driver's drm native
mmap implementation, but that gets real messy plus there's no benefit
because fbdev assumes a bit too much that the memory is permanently
pinned. So we need the pinned kernel vmap anyway.

Cheers, Sima
