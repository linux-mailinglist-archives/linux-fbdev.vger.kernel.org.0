Personally what I've done is to just remove the kerneldoc marker (and
anything else that's obviously wrong) and leave plain comments behind.
At least for old outdated code that no one actively maintains anymore.
Keeps the comment as maybe something useful, and avoids pointless busy
work of inventing kerneldoc which might or might not actually be
correctly describing what's going on.
