My Dear Friend

This letter is to acknowledge the substantial contributions of time and
energy you have made in trying to assist to claim the fund through
your account, despite that it failed us because of your inability to
continue financing the transaction.

Besides I'm happy to inform you that I have succeeded in transferring
the fund out of my home Country with the help of a new partner from
Tuvalu.

I am now in Tuvalu for investment and Tuvalu is composed of 9 coral
atolls along a 360 mile chain in Polynesia. They gained independence
in 1978 the former Ellice Islands.

Therefore in appreciation of your earlier assistance, I have decided to
compensate you with the sum of $850.000.00 USD which I raised in ATM
CARD on your favour.

This fund I have given to you has been deposited with a bank which has
already opened an account and issued to you ATM CARD worth
US$850.000.00 (Eight Hundred and Fifty Thousand United States Dollars)
The ATM CARD is withdrawable from any ATM Machine in the world.

So feel free and contact my Personal assistance (PA) in Benin
Republic, his name is Mr.Stephen Pena

Address: Carre 1299, Ste Rita City
Cotonou,Benin Republic

Email: ( spenaneoris@gmail.com )

and instruct him to send the ATM CARD to you.

Please do let me know immediately you receive it.

Regards,
Mr.Mark Jackson
