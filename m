It's a problem with the hardware. "Write some registers and done"
isn't how display blocks work nowadays. So your proposal amounts to
"no fbdev/fbcon for anything modern-ish".

Also I said "a pile more", most of the issues in fbcon/fbdev code
apply for all drivers.

Except the first oops then scrolls aways because it's getting buried
under further fail. Your locking needs to be minimally good enough to
not make the situation worse.
