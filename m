I've no objections to seeing the DT updated. However I don't really see
what benefit we get from breaking existing DTs in order to do so.

"Cleaning up annoying legacy" is seldom a good reason to break existing
DTs since, if we could break DTs whenever we choose, there would never
be any annoying legacy to worry about. When conflicting properties
result in uninterpretable DTs then a break may be justified but that is
not the case here.
