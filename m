I wrote drivers/gpu/drm/panel/panel-ilitek-ili9341.c to support ili9341
on stm32f429-disco board via dbi or dpi.
https://www.st.com/resource/en/schematic_pack/mb1075-f429i-c01_schematic.pd=
f

As one driver for one panel reason, so porting the mipi_dbi code and
dts binding from tiny/ili9341.c
It's true confused two driver for one panel in current kernel.
I can remove the mipi_dbi code from panel-ilitek-ili9341.c or do something =
else.

Anyway, I'd like to rewrite it based on the agreement.
