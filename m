Hello Lorenzo!

I tried the patches below yesterday with the latest mm tree from git at t=
he
time. I have some work in progress code which uses defio, and hardware wh=
ich
needs that for shuffling bytes around to get the right picture.

There was no obvious difference in operation, it looked the same with and=

without the patches. I've skipped the card's memory initialization so it =

contained garbage while the system memory behind was clean. That garbage
remained and was only cleaned or overwritten where the system memory was
updated by the application. Fbcon wasn't assigned and the app mapped the
memory of course. Left it running at configured to HZ/50 for a while with=

1/3 of the screen updated at ~50 FPS by the test app, nothing interesting=

happened. Same tearing both ways.

I can't comment on performance as the CPU is moving the bytes in the defi=
o
callback and that code is too heavy at the moment to notice a difference.=

Test was performed on a dual core x86-64 (E3400).

So defio seems to still work after these changes for me.
