Right. That is a good point. We don't want to leak a driver implementation
detail in the sysfb code. And in theory there could be for example a DRM
driver for EGA and one for VGA.

Yes, I know the differences. My point was that the orig_video_isVGA was
used to make the distinction and that the same driver supported both, but
as you said that may not be the case and separate drivers could be used.

Yes, and also there's also the monochrome variant of VGA and EGA (VGAM/EGAM).

Should we also make that distinction or for example "vga-framebuffer" should
handle both color and monochrome variants if at some point vgacon is turned
into a fbdev or DRM driver ?

Yes, my point was that the platform device name used to bind is an internal
Linux interface that could be changed later if needed. But I understand your
point and since the platform device names are exposed to user-space, makes
more sense for them to reflect what devices are bound even when the existing
driver doesn't treat them differently.

Indeed. This seems to be a remnant from the time when isVGA was just a bool
and then at some point the field semantics was extended to denote the mode
but the existing users weren't fixed (nor the field named to reflect this).

Probably should be cleaned up at some point but unsure if the churn would
be worth it.

Technically it is something else but Linux conflates them in many places. For
example, as you mentioned one can change the VESA modes using the "vga" param
(which confusingly leads to the use of vesafb+fbcon driver instead of vgacon).

That's why I think that "vga-framebuffer" as driver name would be misleading.
Specially since it would also bind to the "ega-framebuffer" platform device.
