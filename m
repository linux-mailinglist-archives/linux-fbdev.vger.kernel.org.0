Hi Daniel,

Replying "early" (see below), as this was applied to
drm-misc/for-linux-next.

The fbcon acceleration code is indeed not tested by fbset, and it is
purely in-kernel acceleration for the console.

Why 5 combinations?
Enable vfb (which can be a module) and be done with it?

Sure, writing test suites is hard, and takes time.

Sure, you're doing DRM drivers ;-)

That's true for systems that are supported by a DRM driver.

There exist actual products using out-of-tree fbdev drivers that never
got the chance of being merged upstream due to the moratorium on new
fbdev drivers.

BTW, I'm trying to convert an old fbdev driver to DRM, but don't have it
working yet. I had hoped to get something working before replying to
this email, so I could provide more detailed feedback.
