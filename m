Hello Thomas!

Wanted to answer earlier but things took time, and a lot more than expect=
ed.

> First of all, commit 779121e9f175 ("fbdev: Support for byte-reversed

Meanwhile I found out that this implementation had corner cases. I also
expected original implementations be a bit more complete.

In the new version I resorted to only generate tables with them, in
close proximity. The mentioned part made me think when I first run into
it, btw.

I've noticed the screen base vs. buffer issue back then and was already
corrected. But it's handled more cleanly now.

In the new version I made it very hard to get the alignment wrong.

I've used such callbacks but not for the read/writes as that would have
made the parameter list huge, in terms of lines. Not to mention passing
them down to lowest level.

If done slightly differently the compiler inlines these and there's no
overhead.

The vertical loops are small, but I kept them separate from the scanline
rendering part.

Thanks for the tips, that was really helpful and used them when applicabl=
e.

While the updated version is not quite so as described I hope it isn't
too bad either.
