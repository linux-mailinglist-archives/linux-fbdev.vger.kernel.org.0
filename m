As mentioned I don't believe those two things are related. You could make it
backward compatible but still keep the old driver around until no one else
would care about it.

This DRM driver is brand new and there may be bugs, performance issues and
whatnot. At least I won't propose to remove the old fbdev driver but would
want people using DRM to have a choice.

I think that's the crux of the issue. Do we want people to update their
kernel but using their existing Device Tree and be able to switch to the
DRM driver ?

My take is that we should and that's why I kept the backward compatibility.

Maybe we could do that in the meantime and at some point introduce new DT
bindings (with a different compatible string) that would use the latest
and greatest conventions in DT ? That seems to be a good compromise.
