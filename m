Nice!

Bikeshedding - my personal style is to have the likely part first.
This makes reading the code easier.


The following drivers uses deferred io but are not listed as
they need the page list sorted:

- hecubafb
- hyperv_fb
- sh_mobile_lcdcfb
- smscufx
- ssd1307fb 
- xen-fbfront

It would be nice with some info in the commit log that they do not need
the pages sorted.
To make the list complete include the drm stuff too.

It did not jump to me why they did not need sorted pages,
so some sort of reassurance that they have been checked would be nice.

With the following addressed:
Acked-by: Sam Ravnborg <sam@ravnborg.org>

I hope someone else looks that can verify that the list of drivers
without sort_pagelist is correct so someone knowledgeable have looked
too.

	Sam
